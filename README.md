NETIO - Network Benchmark, Version 1.33
(C) 1997-2018 Kai Uwe Rommel

This is a network benchmark for Windows, Linux and Unix that
measures net througput of a network with TCP and UDP protocols.

Currently, I'm not doing any development on this benchmark tool.
This repository is more or less a public resting place for it so people can get it in case there is still interest in it.
